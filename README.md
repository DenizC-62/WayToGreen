# 🌱 WayToGreen

**WayToGreen** is a sustainability-driven blockchain protocol designed to protect and expand forest areas by assigning them measurable ecological and economic value. The project connects real-world environmental impact with transparent digital infrastructure, enabling individuals and companies to interact with forest ecosystems in a verifiable and scalable way.

---

## 📝 Overview

WayToGreen is built on a three-token architecture that transforms natural ecological processes into a transparent, verifiable and decentralized digital system.

### 🌳 TREE – Real Forest Representation  
The **TREE** token corresponds to a unit of real forest land (e.g., one square meter).  
By acquiring TREE tokens, users support the preservation, restoration and expansion of forest areas.  
Forests are often undervalued economically, which leads to deforestation or land conversion.  
TREE creates financial relevance for conserved land, encouraging long-term protection.

### 🟦 O2 – Environmental Value Token  
Forests naturally absorb CO₂ and contribute to the production of oxygen through photosynthesis.  
The **O2** token represents this ecological value by quantifying a measurable unit of environmental benefit generated by forest ecosystems.  
Companies can acquire O2 tokens to offset a portion of their emissions, support ecological restoration, or transparently document sustainability commitments.

### 🟢 GoGreen – Utility & Governance Token  
**GoGreen** is the utility and governance token of the WayToGreen ecosystem.  
It is used for protocol fees, interactions, and participation in governance decisions.  
GoGreen forms the economic backbone of the platform.

## 🎯 Mission

WayToGreen aims to create a global, transparent and sustainable framework in which forest preservation becomes economically meaningful.  
The protocol encourages long-term ecological responsibility, supports regenerative practices, and provides companies with reliable tools to better understand and balance their ecological footprint.

## 🧩 Token Architecture Summary

| Token     | Purpose | Backing | Usage |
|-----------|---------|---------|--------|
| **TREE** | Represents real forest land | Physical land area | Conservation, ownership, ecosystem participation |
| **O2** | Represents ecological output | Forest CO₂ absorption & O₂ production | Emission offsetting, sustainability reporting |
| **GoGreen** | Utility & governance token | Protocol economy | Fees, governance, ecosystem incentives |
