# WayToGreen — Roadmap

The development of WayToGreen follows a phased, long-term strategy built around realistic and sustainable progress. The initial work, taking place throughout 2025, is focused on establishing the conceptual and structural foundations of the protocol. During this period, the core token architecture of TREE, O2 and GoGreen is defined, the ecological valuation model is drafted, and the first versions of the whitepaper and documentation are created. The repository, technical structure and overarching system vision are shaped in a way that allows the project to grow methodically over time.

As the conceptual groundwork matures, the project transitions into the next stage of preparation during 2026. This phase is centered on translating theory into a coherent technical direction. The principles underlying the smart contracts are developed, initial designs for forest-mapping and verification mechanisms are formulated, and the early logic of how ecological data interacts with digital representation is refined. In parallel, early work begins on the layout and structure of the WayToGreen website and user interface, ensuring that the project’s public-facing components evolve alongside its internal architecture.

Once these elements reach sufficient stability, WayToGreen moves into its early development phase, beginning in 2026 and extending into 2027. During this stage, the first prototypes of the smart contracts are created and tested. Although not yet intended for public use, these prototypes validate the system’s basic mechanics and allow the team to identify areas for improvement. The ecological valuation model is also implemented in an initial form, enabling the first simulations of how environmental contributions can translate into O2 values. This marks the point at which the protocol begins to take shape as a functioning system rather than a conceptual design.

Building on these foundations, the project enters the testnet phase around 2027. The smart contracts are deployed on a public test network, allowing broader testing and feedback. A preliminary version of the WayToGreen dashboard is introduced, providing users with their first opportunity to interact with the protocol visually. Simulated ecological data and controlled testing conditions help assess the behaviour of the system in practice. The insights gained from this stage play a crucial role in preparing the project for a larger audience.

As the testnet phase evolves, WayToGreen gradually approaches its first operational release. Beginning in 2028, a beta version of the ecosystem becomes available, bringing together the essential components of the platform: the dashboard, mapping logic, token mechanics and early marketplace functionality. During this period, collaboration with environmental partners enables the onboarding of real forest areas, making it possible for genuine ecological data to influence the production of O2 values. This represents a significant milestone, where the digital and physical dimensions of the project connect for the first time.

Looking beyond its initial launch, WayToGreen is built with a long-term vision for continuous expansion and refinement. Future years will focus on improving the ecological valuation model, enhancing verification methods, deepening partnerships with environmental organizations and introducing decentralized governance through the GoGreen token. Over time, the project aims to evolve into a comprehensive regenerative-finance ecosystem in which environmental responsibility and technological innovation reinforce each other on a global scale.
